# Netflix Time Series Analysis (2012–2024)

This project presents a comprehensive time series analysis of **Netflix subscriber growth and engagement trends** from 2012 through 2024.  
The objective was to identify long-term patterns, visualize subscriber dynamics, and generate reliable forecasts using Tableau’s built-in time series and exponential smoothing tools.

---

## Project Overview

The study examines how Netflix’s global reach and subscriber behavior have evolved over a twelve-year period.  
Time series forecasting models were applied to project future subscription growth and content engagement levels.  
Visualizations were developed in Tableau to highlight historical patterns, seasonality, and emerging trends across years.

The project integrates quantitative analysis with visual analytics to produce both descriptive and predictive insights relevant to business strategy and media forecasting.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation  
Historical data were organized into a temporal structure representing quarterly subscriber counts, viewing metrics, and market segments.  
Data cleaning and preprocessing were conducted prior to visualization to ensure consistency across time periods.

### 2. Visualization and Analysis  
Time series plots, moving averages, and trend lines were created to capture the underlying structure of subscriber growth.  
Forecasting was performed using Tableau’s built-in **exponential smoothing** and **trend-based prediction** features, allowing estimation of future values with 95% confidence intervals.

### 3. Forecast Interpretation  
Forecasts indicated continued subscriber growth through 2024, though with diminishing marginal increases as market saturation approached.  
Confidence bands and seasonal decomposition highlighted both predictable annual variation and long-term trend stabilization.

## Key Insights

- Netflix’s subscriber base exhibits strong long-term growth with identifiable seasonal fluctuations.  
- Forecasts suggest continued expansion through 2024, albeit at a slower rate due to market maturity.  
- Peak engagement periods align closely with new content release cycles and holiday quarters.  
- Tableau’s forecasting tools provide interpretable, interactive models suitable for business decision support.
